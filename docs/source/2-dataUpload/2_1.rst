=============================

Once the users have accessed with the proper credentials, and have been granted with the proper permissions, they will be allowed to proceed with the upload of the WQP maps. 

The first step, is to reach the layers page (see :numref:`1_2_1`). To reach the *Layers Page*, the user must click on tab on the top of the window **Data** ï¿« **Layers**.

Layers Page
-----------

On the Layers page, a list of the available spatial datasets will be prompted. The layers presented in the list can be explored, visualized and downloaded from the available datasets (if the data provider allows it to).

.. attention::
    GeoNode enables users the upload vector and raster data in their original projections. There is broad support for vector data formats (such as ESRI shapefiles, KML files, GeoJSON and others). Raster data, such as satellite images and other datasets, can be uploaded in GeoTIFF format.

When the user triggers the Select File button, a prompt of an explorer window will appear. In this window, search for the file's location, select it and click **open**.
