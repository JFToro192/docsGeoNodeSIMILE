Manage Users and Groups
=======================

On this page, you will find the steps to take advantage of the Django administrative dashboard to create new users on the platform and add them to new groups. Within this process, you will become familiar with creating new groups.

.. note::

    Remember to log in to the platform as an administrative user for the upcoming steps.

-----------------------

Add/Modify/Remove Users
-----------------------

On the top menu, open the ``About`` item and select the ``Add User`` option. The option will redirect you to GeoNode's administrative dashboard.

In the page presented in :numref:`4_2`, the user must input the credentials for the new user and then ``Save``.

    New user credentials

With the new user's credentials defined, the next step involves assigning the corresponding user's contact information and permissions. After compiling the requested information, click on ``Save``.

.. hint::
    * Active: If the user is considered active in the platform (without the need to eliminate, if inactive)
    * Staff privileges: If the user can access the administrative dashboard
    * Superuser privileges: Assign all the rights for managing the dashboard

After storing the user, it will appear in the list of existing users on the platform. To head back to the main webpage, click ``View Site`` (at the top right of the screen).

Following the new group creation will prompt its page (see :numref:`4_7`). Notice that the group has an existing member (corresponding to the creator of the group).

For adding a new group member, it is sufficient to query them in the search bar, select them and click on ``add member to the group``.


.. note::

    Please pay attention to the different actions available for managing each user; they can be defined as Manager, Removed or Demoted.
